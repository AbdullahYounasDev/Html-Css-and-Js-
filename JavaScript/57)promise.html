    // A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an operation.
    // First of all, a Promise is an object. There are 3 states of the Promise object: 
    // Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails. 
    // Resolved: Completed Promise. 
    // Rejected: Failed Promise.

    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        console.log("Hello World")
        resolve(23)
    })

    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("I am Abdullah Younas")
    }, 2000);
    // state: — initially "pending" , then changes to either "fulfilled" when resolve is called or "rejected" when reject is called.
    // result: — initially undefined , then changes to value when resolve(value) is called or error when reject(error) is called.
